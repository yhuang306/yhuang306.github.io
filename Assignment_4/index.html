                    <p>A peach is a very sweet, juicy fruit with an edible peel and a hard pit in the middle. Peaches vary in color from almost white to yellow and pinkish-red.</p>

                <p>Like peaches and plums, mangoes have an inedible pit at the center. Unlike these other fruits, the skin of a mango is very tough and also inedible. Mangoes grow in the warm climate of South Asia, and are the official nationalal fruit of Pakistan, India, and the Philippines. This tasty fruit was first imported to North America in the 17th century in a pickled form.</p>

                <p>Peaches grow on trees in temperate climates â€” they need warm weather, but they also require a hard freeze in the winter to produce fruit. Before the fruit grows on the tree, it blooms in beautiful pink blossoms. Ripe peaches drip with sweetness.</p>
